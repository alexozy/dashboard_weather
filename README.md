# Dashboard Weather Application: Search Your City

## Description of Project

For this application, we were tasked with creating an interactive dashboard that can display a weather forecast for any city a user may type into the search-bar! We utilized a custom API key and the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data.
